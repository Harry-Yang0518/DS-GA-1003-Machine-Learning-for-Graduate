# DS-GA-1003-Machine-Learning-for-Graduate
Self Study Material (2023 Fall, Sophomore)
Course Information
Course Description: The course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. While mathematical methods and theoretical aspects will be covered, the primary goal is to provide students with the tools and principles needed to solve the data science problems found in practice. This course will serve as a foundation of knowledge on which more advanced courses and further independent study can build.
Prerequisites:
Introduction to Data Science (DS-GA 1001), or equivalent
Statistical and Mathematical Methods (DS-GA 1002), or equivalent
Solid mathematical background, equivalent to a 1-semester undergraduate course in each of the following: linear algebra, multivariate calculus, probability theory, and statistics (DS-GA 1002 covers the necessary material)
Python programming required for most homework assignments
Recommended: Computer science background up to a course in data structures and algorithms
Recommended: At least one advanced, proof-based mathematics course
Some prerequisites may be waived with permission of the instructor
